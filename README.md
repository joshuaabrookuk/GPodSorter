## Description

Fed up of manually swiping podcasts in the order I wanted, I wrote a little bit of javascript to reorder them. Saving the queue order was a bit messy, having to manually target the button and simulate a click. I found this collection of js useful so I packaged it into an extension.

While it caters to my needs with some patience, this extension will likey become obsolete soon as Google Podcasts will go the way of Play Music and be merged with YouTube.
